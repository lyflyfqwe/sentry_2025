[33mCMake Warning at CMakeLists.txt:20 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findaltitude_map.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "altitude_map", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "altitude_map" with
  any of the following names:

    altitude_mapConfig.cmake
    altitude_map-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "altitude_map" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "altitude_map_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "altitude_map" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
